# Shared wake classifier: the common source of truth for captain-relevant status
# tests, declared-external-wait vocabulary, and the working/paused absorb
# classification that makes no-verb signal and stale-pane wakes safe to absorb.
# Sourced by BOTH the always-on watcher
# (bin/fm-watch.sh) and the away-mode daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh) so the
# overlapping triage policy lives in one place instead of two copies that can
# drift apart.
#
# Most functions are pure, side-effect-free reads of status files: each takes
# what it needs as arguments and touches no globals beyond the optional
# FM_CAPTAIN_RE override. Consumers layer their own dedup/marker state on top (the
# daemon keeps its escalation-digest seen-markers; the watcher keeps its .seen-*
# signatures).
# Status-span classification captures one file endpoint and reports every
# actionable event through that endpoint before the endpoint may be committed.
# An absent status file is a successful empty span, while an existing status
# object that cannot be read or identified is a classification failure with no
# committable endpoint.
# A presentation marker independently stores the last reported file signature
# and the last successfully classified position.
# Successful classification advances both facts through the captured endpoint;
# after a failure is reported, only the reported signature advances, so the same
# observed state alarms once while every unclassified byte remains for recovery.
# The reported signature includes path type, mode, symlink target, and observable
# failure kind, so a readability change is a new state that triggers another read.
# A missing, malformed, identity-mismatched, or past-end classified position reads
# from byte 0, preferring a bounded duplicate over a lost event.
#
# There are six documented exceptions. The absorb classification
# (crew_absorb_class and its working/paused wrappers) is NOT a pure status-file
# read: it reuses bin/fm-crew-state.sh, which may make a bounded no-mistakes call,
# to decide whether a crew that just stopped its turn or went stale is working,
# deliberately paused, or neither. Callers run it ONLY on no-verb signal handling
# and first sighting of a stale hash, never on every wake, so the per-wake triage
# stays cheap. status_open_decisions_incremental (see "incremental (cursor-backed)
# open-decisions fold" below) also writes: it persists a per-status-file byte
# cursor and folded open-set as a side effect, so a per-drain fleet-wide scan
# stays bounded by new appends instead of re-reading each task's whole lifetime
# log every time. crew_worktree_written_since reads the task's meta file and walks
# a bounded slice of its worktree instead of a status file, so callers run it only
# at the moment they would otherwise escalate. crew_nm_run_process_alive reads that
# same meta file and then the live process table, including the parent of each
# candidate so firstmate's own bounded queries never read as crew progress, for the
# same callers under the same rule: it answers whether a validation run is bound to
# this task's worktree when no run step could be attributed at all. The cwd-binding
# scan that probe and bin/fm-teardown.sh both read (fm_cwd_scan_capture and
# fm_pids_with_cwd_under) is the exception to the no-globals rule as well: it
# publishes its result, and its opt-in single-cycle reuse, in module globals, so a
# caller must run it in the shell that owns the cycle rather than inside a command
# substitution. Its own block below owns that contract. status_done_guard_defer
# (see "PR-delivery done contract guard" below) writes a steering-inbox record and
# its own reminder budget, because a done: that does not satisfy its task's
# pull-request delivery contract is withheld from the actionable set only when the
# worker has provably been steered back to that contract in its place.

# --- durable keyed decisions ------------------------------------------------
#
# The status stream is an append-only EVENT log. Reading it last-event-wins
# (last_status_line above) cannot represent "an earlier decision is still open
# after a later, unrelated event": a subsequent done/paused/working line silently
# masks a still-open needs-decision. status_open_decisions is the ONE authoritative
# statement of the status-fold contract that fixes this - a needs-decision/blocked
# line OPENS a keyed decision, and only an explicit resolution or a verified
# captain-held backlog transfer referencing that key CLOSES it; a later unrelated
# terminal line never clears an open captain decision.
# Who WRITES the closing line is owned elsewhere: the answering firstmate closes
# at answer time through fm-send's --resolve-key (bin/fm-send.sh header), and a
# worker self-closes only a blocker that cleared without an answer (bin/fm-brief.sh
# rule 6), so closure never depends on a busy worker's discipline.
#
# Decision key grammar (backward-compatible with the existing "<verb>: <note>"
# format): an OPTIONAL "[key=<slug>]" token names the decision. Its documented
# position sits between the verb and the colon, and a complete token at the
# head of the note is accepted as an EQUIVALENT position, because that
# misplaced-colon shape is common real worker output whose stated key must
# never silently collapse into the shared "default" bucket (issue #2109):
#   needs-decision [key=api-shape]: <summary>
#   needs-decision: [key=api-shape] <summary>
#   resolved       [key=api-shape]: <how it was decided>
# Both positions state the same key and yield the same note (a consumed
# note-head token is key metadata, stripped from the note); when both positions
# carry a token, the documented before-colon one wins and the note-head token
# stays note text. A token deeper inside the note is prose, never a stated key,
# so a summary merely MENTIONING "[key=x]" cannot open or close that decision.
# A line with no token in either position uses the key "default", preserving
# the historical one-open-decision-per-task behavior (a bare "resolved:" closes
# "default"). A stated key whose slug fails the charset below is rejected (the
# folds skip the line), never rewritten to "default".
# The parsers are pure reads of a single line. Status metadata may contain any
# number of "[name=value]" tags before the colon, in any order, so verb parsing
# ends at the first tag rather than special-casing "[key=...]".
#
# Correlation tokens. That bracket rule already covers every BRACKETED tag,
# including the "[corr=<16 hex>]" form bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh writes. It
# does not cover the UNBRACKETED token that bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh writes
# (fm_pending_reply_corr_token), which a secondmate answering a marked request
# echoes on its parent status line ahead of the key tag (bin/fm-brief.sh), so a
# real transition routinely arrives as
#   needs-decision corr=<16 hex> [key=texte-du-mur]: <summary>
#   resolved       corr=<16 hex> [key=texte-du-mur]: <how it was decided>
# and a recovery turn can leave two such tokens on one line. All of those must
# read as the bare verb, in BOTH directions: a verb parse that keeps the token
# glued on matches no arm of _fm_decision_fold_line, so the opener never opens
# and the closer never closes, and a captain decision goes silently missing.
# Recognition starts only AFTER the retained leading verb: a token-first line
# keeps that token, so its following word cannot impersonate a transition and
# close a decision the captain is owed.
#
# The token grammar is OWNED by bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh
# (fm_pending_reply_corr_token, FM_PENDING_REPLY_CORR_RE). That library sources
# this one, so it cannot be sourced back here; the pattern below is a deliberate
# second statement of the SHAPE alone, and tests/fm-classify-corr-token.test.sh
# pins the two together through the real writers so they cannot drift.
#
# Recognition is deliberately narrow: EXACTLY the token that writer emits, whole
# word, and nothing else. An arbitrary "<name>=<value>" token is NOT skipped.
# Skipping unknown tokens would be the permissive road - it would let any
# free-text word carrying an equals sign ("resolved x=1 [key=k]: ...") reduce to
# a bare verb and impersonate a transition, which is the takeover the strict
# parse and _fm_decision_key_transition_allowed exist to prevent. Recognising
# only what a firstmate library actually writes costs one more line here each
# time a real new token shape is introduced, and that is the intended trade: a
# new shape is a deliberate, reviewed edit rather than a silent widening. A line
# whose token is malformed, wrong-length, or merely mentioned in prose keeps its
# extra words and therefore stays a non-transition, exactly as before.
#
# The 16 hex classes are written out literally rather than built from a
# variable, the same way bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh validates the id it is
# handed: a variable holding a glob is only re-read as a pattern under some
# shells' expansion rules, and a safety parse must not turn on that.

# --- incremental (cursor-backed) open-decisions fold ------------------------
#
# status_open_decisions above re-reads and re-folds a status file's ENTIRE
# lifetime on every call, so its cost grows with total log size. A per-drain
# fleet-wide scan using that whole-file function would pay that cost for every
# task on every wake, which grows unbounded as tasks run longer and accumulate
# status history. status_open_decisions_incremental and scan_open_decisions_incremental
# below are the bounded-cost siblings used for that per-drain path: each call
# reads only the bytes appended to a status file since its own last call (a
# persisted per-file byte cursor) and folds just those new lines into a
# persisted running open-set, via the exact same _fm_decision_fold_line rule
# status_open_decisions uses - so the two strategies can never disagree on what
# is open. Cost is bounded by NEW appends since the last drain, not by the
# status file's total lifetime size.
#
# Correctness invariant (unchanged from the whole-file fold): an open decision
# is dropped ONLY by an explicit resolved/captain-held line for its exact key,
# never by cursor advancement, age, or being buried under later appends - the
# persisted open-set carries every still-open key forward across calls
# regardless of how much new unrelated log content has since been folded in.
#
# The cursor format is `version`, `offset`, `ident`, then the folded open set.
# FM_OPEN_DECISIONS_FOLD_VERSION must be bumped whenever
# _fm_decision_fold_line semantics change, so persisted state from an older
# interpretation is discarded and rebuilt from byte 0.
#
# Cursor invalidation is deliberately minimal, matching how status files are
# ACTUALLY used in this repo: every one is created once (`>`) and only ever
# appended to (`>>`) - never replaced, renamed, or rewritten in place. So the
# ways a cursor can go stale are a fold-version mismatch, a shrink (truncated),
# or the file at this path being a different file than before
# (replaced/rotated/recreated), which a changed device+inode makes an O(1) check
# via a single `stat` call - no content hashing, no re-reading the consumed
# prefix. Any signal falls back to a full re-fold of the whole current file from
# byte 0 - byte for byte what status_open_decisions itself would compute - and
# rewrites the cursor from that clean baseline. A same-inode, same-size,
# in-place byte edit is NOT detected; that is a deliberately accepted gap
# because no code path in this repo ever does that to a status file.
#
# The other real failure mode is OUR OWN read failing (a stat/wc/tail I/O
# error), not a malformed writer: every such read here is checked, and on
# failure this reports the already-trusted persisted set unchanged rather than
# risking a silent invalidation that would wipe it - never a bare "empty" as if
# nothing were open.
#
# Not a pure status-file read: this writes/rewrites the sibling cursor file as a
# side effect (state/.<task>.open-decisions-cursor), the library's second
# documented exception to the pure-read rule after crew_absorb_class. The write
# is atomic (temp file + rename), so a crash between calls leaves either the
# prior cursor or the new one, never a partial one. bin/fm-wake-drain.sh calls
# this only after releasing the wake-queue lock, so a hypothetical race between
# two overlapping drains can at worst redo a little folding work twice - never
# drop an open decision - because a losing writer's offset can only ever be
# equal to or behind an already-recorded byte position, and the next call
# re-derives from whatever offset actually landed on disk.

# --- unread status lines since the presentation cursor ----------------------
#
# The drain annotation historically printed only the newest status line, so a
# substantive `note:` answer immediately followed by a routine `note:` (or a
# pending-reply resolution buried under a later unrelated append) never reached
# the supervisor. Those verbs also never enter the OPEN DECISIONS fold, so they
# had no other surfacing path.
# These helpers are the ONE owner of "what is still unread since the last drain
# presentation": one fleet manifest records each status identity and last-
# presented byte offset, and one atomic replacement commits only the contiguous
# status spans that were successfully presented. A quiet fleet scan leaves
# routine working/done bytes unacknowledged so a subsequently published signal
# can still annotate them. A missing manifest row or changed file identity is
# offset 0 for the current file, while malformed or unreadable cursor state
# aborts presentation without advancing any offset. A trusted cursor at EOF
# prints nothing, so already-presented bytes are not replayed as new. Teardown
# retires a task's manifest row with its status file, so reusing a task ID starts
# the replacement log unread at byte 0. Informational `note:` lines and
# reserved-key pending-reply resolutions are the fleet-wide unread surface;
# they are not open decisions and are not persisted in the folded open-set.

# Read the legacy per-task open-decisions cursor used to seed the presentation
# offset before the fleet manifest exists. A fold-version mismatch, identity
# mismatch, or offset past the current size falls back to 0. Never writes unless
# a caller explicitly requests a migration snapshot.

# --- PR-delivery done contract guard ----------------------------------------
#
# A ship task recorded as mode=no-mistakes or mode=direct-PR delivers through a
# pull request, so the `done:` that completes it MUST carry that PR's link.
# bin/fm-dod-lib.sh's fm_dod_done_form owns the exact form each mode's brief
# states, and this guard holds the worker to that same string. A `done:` with no
# link is not a completion: it is a worker that stopped at "my local tests pass".
# Presenting one as a done is what let three workers in a single night be
# recorded as finished with no pipeline run and no pull request.
#
# The guard is mechanical rather than advisory. status_span_first_actionable_record
# withholds such a line from the actionable set and instead enqueues ONE contract
# reminder into that task's own steering inbox (bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh), so the
# worker is steered back onto its delivery path and the task keeps reading as
# working. That reminder write and the budget record below are this library's
# SIXTH documented exception to the pure-read contract in the file header.
#
# Firstmate is woken only when the reminder does not take, along two independent
# bounded paths:
#   - the reminder is an ORDINARY inbox record, so the watcher's existing re-ring
#     ladder escalates it as a stale wake once the worker has left it
#     unacknowledged for FM_TASK_INBOX_GRACE_SECS * (FM_TASK_INBOX_RING_MAX + 1),
#     about six minutes on the defaults (bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh owns the ladder);
#   - the guard spends at most FM_DONE_GUARD_REMINDER_MAX reminders per task, so a
#     worker that keeps re-reporting a linkless done has its next such line
#     presented to firstmate unchanged instead of absorbed again. Re-reporting is
#     counted by APPEND and not by text: a worker that acknowledged its reminder
#     and then wrote the byte-identical done again has written a NEW line, so it
#     is steered again and spends budget, while one append re-read by a second
#     cursor is not (status_done_guard_defer owns how the two are told apart).
# An inbox that cannot be written, or a budget that cannot be persisted, also
# presents the line: the guard withholds a captain event only when it has provably
# steered the worker in its place.
#
# local-only is deliberately out of scope. It has no pull request, its own
# terminal form is unchanged, and nothing here reads or writes its state. A task
# with no recorded delivery mode - a scout, a secondmate, an adopted or foreign
# log - is untouched for the same reason.
#
# The guard judges a task's CURRENT state and never its history: only the log's
# newest line is acted on (status_line_is_newest owns why), and a linkless done
# replayed by a whole-log re-read is dropped rather than re-steered or
# re-presented - but only one PROVABLY judged already
# (status_done_guard_line_was_judged owns the witnesses), because one span covers
# every byte since the cursor, so a done can be seen for the first time already
# non-newest and swallowing that one would arm neither bounded path. Every consumer that decides whether a line is a FINISH asks the
# pure status_done_contract_unmet - the always-on watcher's stale-terminal test,
# the away-mode supervisor's signal and stale wake classifications and its wedge
# aging, both of bin/fm-crew-state.sh's status-log paths (its verb mapping and
# its ci-ready gate), both of bin/fm-inactive-reconcile.sh's finish tests (a
# secondmate's parent-channel ledger, and the direct path's deferral to that
# ledger), and bin/fm-captain-hold.sh's open-decision retirement -
# so the classifier and the authoritative current-state reader cannot disagree
# about whether a task is finished, and nothing retires a captain's open decision
# on the word of a line no other reader accepts. A consumer deciding whether to suppress a LIVE presentation asks
# status_done_guard_holds instead, because a line whose reminder budget is spent
# is deliberately firstmate's to see and must stay recoverable. One absorbing a
# wake BECAUSE the worker holds a durable instruction asks status_done_guard_steering,
# which a superseded line no longer answers: the steering that bounds such an
# absorption ended when the outcome was published.
#
# A withheld done is published nowhere, with ONE named exception: inactive
# reconciliation may publish a terminal outcome for such a line when the run-step
# verdict behind it carries a recorded pull request, because a pipeline that
# reached green CI on a real pull request is the contract's own proof and
# outranks the worker's prose. The same verdict with NO recorded pull request is
# not that proof and stays withheld. Publishing that outcome also SUPERSEDES the
# prose line (status_done_guard_supersede), so a worker whose pull request is
# already reported stops being steered about the sentence it wrote on the way
# there; a later append of the same text is a new line the marker does not cover.

# bin/fm-pr-lib.sh's fm_pr_url_parse, even though that function is the one owner
# of what a task PR URL is. The two answer different questions. fm_pr_url_parse

# only github.com and recognized GitLab hosts; this asks "did the worker deliver
# a pull request at all". Using the stricter one here would withhold a genuine
# `done: PR <url> checks green` raised on any other host and steer that worker in
# circles until its reminder budget ran out - the guard failing in the one
# direction its own doctrine forbids, since it may withhold a captain event only
# when it can prove it should. Keeping the shape test local also means this
# predicate loads nothing and therefore has no undecidable state to leak.

# behind a static pane - the 2026-08-14 case of eight consecutive possible-wedge
# escalations against a crew that was demonstrably working the whole time.
#
# 1 for every other outcome, including an id with no recorded worktree, a worktree
# that is gone, a missing anchor, and a walk that fails or finds nothing. Absence of
# evidence therefore always leaves the caller's existing escalation schedule
# untouched, so a crew that writes nothing still escalates exactly as before.
#
# A kind=secondmate task records a provisioned firstmate home, not a code tree, and
# such a home runs its OWN supervision inside it: its state/ directory churns a
# watcher beacon, pane hashes, and heartbeats whether or not the mate is producing
# anything, so a walk there would report liveness for a mate that has done nothing.
# Those homes are excluded outright rather than by pruning "state", which would also
# hide a legitimate source directory of that name in an ordinary worktree. The
# exclusion is a negative outcome like any other, so an unproductive mate keeps
# escalating on the caller's unchanged schedule.
#
# The anchor is the caller's own idle-window timer file, whose mtime already marks
# when the quiet window opened, so `-newer` needs no clock arithmetic, no temp
# file, and no portable mtime-setting. Not a pure status-file read (see the header):
# one pruned, depth-bounded, wall-clock-bounded walk per call, which callers must
# reach only when they are otherwise about to escalate, never on every poll. A walk
# that outlives FM_WORKTREE_WRITE_TIMEOUT is killed and reported as no evidence, so
# a hung mount costs the escalation nothing but the bound. -xdev holds that walk to the
# worktree's own filesystem rather than descending into a nested network or container

# escalation that should have fired, the unsafe direction, so the memo's lifetime
# is exactly one cycle and no longer.
#
# A FAILED scan is remembered too, as a failure rather than as a result. The scan
# is system-wide, so a missing lsof, an error or a timeout is a fact about the
# cycle and not about the window that happened to ask first; re-running it inside
# the same cycle cannot answer differently and only pays the same wall-clock bound
# again. What a remembered failure never becomes is "no processes": every caller
# still gets the same no-evidence failure it gets today, so no escalation schedule
# changes and only the cost of learning it moves from once per caller to once per

# 0 when a live no-mistakes validation process is bound to <id>'s own worktree:
# positive, mechanical evidence that this task is progressing even though its pane
# has gone quiet and no run step could be attributed to it.
#
# This is the fourth liveness input the wedge detector has, after pane quietness,
# the run step, and the worktree write probe above, and it exists because the run
# step is not always readable. bin/fm-crew-state.sh attributes a run only through a
# bounded `no-mistakes axi status` call; when that call times out or answers for
# another branch there is no run step at all, and a crew sitting in a long fix or
# review round behind a static pane reads exactly like a wedged one - the
# 2026-09-02 case of a crew escalated as a possible wedge, twice, while its own
# `no-mistakes axi respond --action fix` had been running for eleven minutes.
#
# Two independent signals must BOTH hold, because a false positive here silences a
# wedge alarm, which is the unsafe direction:
#   - the process's working directory is under this task's recorded worktree, the
#     kernel fact that binds it to this task and nothing else, and
#   - its executable is the no-mistakes binary, which is what makes it a validation
#     run rather than an unrelated process the crew happened to leave behind.
# Shared no-mistakes infrastructure is excluded by subcommand even when it
# satisfies both, per FM_NM_PROCESS_SHARED_SUBCOMMANDS above.
#
# Firstmate's OWN no-mistakes invocations are excluded by launcher, which no
# subcommand filter could do: bin/fm-crew-state.sh reads a crew's run step with a
# bounded `no-mistakes axi status` run inside that crew's own worktree, the fleet
# snapshot forks one per crew in the background, and a real fix round shares its
# `axi` first argument, so both signals hold for a query that proves nothing about
# the crew. crew_nm_process_is_crew_launched below is what separates them, by
# reading FM_NM_OWN_RUN_MARK from the candidate's direct parent.
#
# 1 for every other outcome, including an id with no recorded worktree, a worktree
# that is gone, a secondmate task or any other task whose recorded worktree is a
# provisioned firstmate home rather than a code tree, a scan that cannot run
# because lsof is absent, and a scan that fails or times out. Absence of evidence
# is never absorption: every one of those leaves the caller's existing escalation
# schedule exactly as it was, so a genuinely wedged crew still escalates on the
# unchanged schedule and a home without lsof loses nothing it had before.
#
# A provisioned firstmate home is excluded exactly as the worktree probe above
# excludes it, by BOTH kind=secondmate and the home's own marker, and for the same
# reason: such a home runs its own supervision and its own validation inside
# itself, so a process living there says nothing about the task that recorded it.
# The marker is the load-bearing half here - a kind=secondmate window is triaged
# only under a declared pause, which takes the recheck cadence rather than the
# wedge timer, so the window that actually reaches this probe with a mate home
# recorded is an ordinary crew one - and the kind check is kept beside it because
# it is cheap and still covers any future caller that arrives with a mate window.
#
# 0 only when <pid> is PROVABLY not one of firstmate's own no-mistakes
# invocations: its direct parent's argument vector is readable and does not carry
# FM_NM_OWN_RUN_MARK. 1 for firstmate's own, and 1 for every pid whose lineage
# cannot be established at all, so an unreadable answer is treated as "cannot prove
# this is the crew's own run" and leaves the escalation schedule untouched, the
# same direction every other unknown in this probe takes.
#
# The parent is where the mark lives because `env` execs the real command in place:
# bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh states that contract and owns the mark. The parent id is
# read from /proc where a proc filesystem exists and from `ps` otherwise, the same
# platform split bin/fm-teardown.sh's task_process_identity uses, and the parent's
# argument vector is read with `ps`, which reports it on both platforms (a process
# ENVIRONMENT is not readable for another process on macOS, which is why the mark
# is an argument rather than an exported variable).
#
# A candidate whose launcher already exited is reparented to init, whose argument
# vector reads normally and carries no mark, so an ordinary crew run outliving its
# shell still counts as progress exactly as before.
