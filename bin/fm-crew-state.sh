# fm-crew-state.sh - deterministic read of a crew's CURRENT state.
#
# Why this exists: state/<id>.status is an append-only, best-effort EVENT LOG.
# Crews append only wake-worthy transitions (done/needs-decision/blocked/paused/failed)
# and nothing when they silently resume, so `tail -1` of that log reports the
# last EVENT, not the current STATE. After firstmate resolves a needs-decision
# or blocked and the crew resumes (responds to the gate, the pipeline fixes, it
# re-validates), the log's last line stays stale. This helper never infers the
# current state from a tail of the log: it reads the authoritative source (a
# no-mistakes run-step attributed under bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh's contract, else
# the pane busy-signature) and reconciles the possibly-stale log against it.
#
# The determinism lives entirely here - only run-step / pane / log reads plus
# fixed mapping logic, no heuristics and no LLM. Output is one stable, parseable,
# token-tight line firstmate can read every heartbeat:
#
#   state: <working|parked|done|blocked|paused|failed|unknown> · source: <run-step|pane|status-log|remote-endpoint|none> · <detail>
#
# Logic, in order:
#   1. Resolve worktree + backend target + kind from state/<id>.meta. A meta
#      recording remote_host= is a remote secondmate: its worktree and endpoint
#      live on that host, so the local worktree and pane reads are skipped and
#      the remote host is asked for the endpoint's recovery-grade state
#      (fm-on.sh + fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh state). alive falls through
#      to the routed status log; dead/missing report the remote verdict; an
#      unreachable or unreadable remote reports unknown-remote, never a false
#      gone/dead.
#   2. Matching no-mistakes run for this crew's branch AND current code identity,
#      active or terminal (from `axi status`, or the coarse `no-mistakes runs`
#      fallback)? Branch name alone is not enough: a historical run on a reused
#      branch whose head was rewritten or diverged must not be attributed.
#      A run matches when its head equals the worktree HEAD, or the worktree HEAD
#      is an ancestor of the run head (pipeline fix commits advanced the run on
#      the same line of history). Local work that advanced past the run head, or
#      diverged from it, invalidates attribution. While the pipeline owns the
#      branch (branch_sync.state=pipeline_owned), its own custody attribution
#      binds an ACTIVE run without head equality (fm_nm_run_is_pipeline_owned_active
#      in bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh).
#      A run head whose commit object the task copy never fetched (the pipeline
#      committed its fix round in its own checkout) cannot be verified locally;
#      that row is recognized only as a provable pipeline-owned continuation -
#      the branch's ACTIVE newest ledger row, anchored by the row immediately
#      before it having ended at exactly this worktree's head - so an active fix
#      round never reads as an older failed run (rule owned by
#      fm_nm_runs_status_for_worktree in bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh).
#      The run-step is AUTHORITATIVE: running/fixing -> working, ci -> working,
#      awaiting_approval/fix_review -> parked (with gate findings), terminal
#      passed/checks-passed -> done, failed/cancelled -> failed. EXCEPT: while
#      the active step is ci, `axi status` alone cannot tell "still waiting on
#      checks" from "checks green, waiting on merge" (see nm_ci_checks_state) -
#      a ci-step log-tail check overrides working -> done once checks read
#      green, so a green PR is never silently read as still-validating.
#   3. Reconcile the status log: if its last line says needs-decision/blocked but
#      the run-step shows the run moved on, the log is deterministically stale and
#      is flagged superseded. A genuinely parked run plus a needs-decision log
#      agree, and are reported as parked. A `blocked:` line that reports a
#      refused or missing daemon socket remains blocked even if an attributed
#      run record is stale or terminal. Other daemon, timeout, or unreachability
#      claims are superseded BECAUSE THE RUN IS ALIVE when the run is
#      running/fixing with recent reported activity: a killed or timed-out drive
#      call is not daemon death, so that claim is answered by steering the crew
#      to reattach, not by escalating.
#   4. No run for this crew (pre-validation, or kind=scout): fall back to the
#      recorded backend's pane busy state, then the status log's last line only
#      when its verb maps to a recognized run-state. Decision-only events such as
#      `resolved` never become current state or detail.
#   5. Missing meta or torn-down worktree: report unknown · none. If no run is
#      attributed to this crew, a dead endpoint also reports unknown · none rather
#      than trusting a stale status log. On tmux and herdr, which own a
#      recovery-grade classifier, only its positive death evidence reads as gone
#      (the endpoint is authoritatively absent, or its pane holds no agent); an
#      endpoint that merely failed to answer reports unknown · none as
#      unreachable, and an alive endpoint whose scrollback read failed is still
#      classified by step 4. Backends with no classifier keep reading a failed
#      capture as gone. The fallback's own comment owns the per-verdict rules.
#
# Read-only and side-effect free. Always exits 0 on a successful read regardless
# of state; exit 2 only on a usage error (no id).
